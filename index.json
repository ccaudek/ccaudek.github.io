To investigate error-driven adjustments in cognitive control, in one study we have considered performance changes in posterror trials, when participants performed a visual search task requiring detection of angry, happy, or neutral facial expressions in crowds of faces. Whereas current models always predict a slowing down of performance after an error, we found the opposite result: when participants failed to detect the presence of a threatening face, in the following trial they were more efficient: their RTs tended to be faster with no accuracy cost. The impact of threat-detection failure on cognitive control, as revealed by the present study, suggests that posterror adjustments should be understood as the product of domain-specific mechanisms that are strongly influenced by affective information, rather than as the effect of a general-purpose error-monitoring system.\n","date":1593734400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593734400,"objectID":"d83aadb3ca676161b73d88d8ee3d12f3","permalink":"/project/cog-control-project/","publishdate":"2020-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cog-control-project/","section":"project","summary":"Anger Superiority Effect and post-error adjustment.","tags":["Cognitive control","Post-error adjustment"],"title":"Cognitive control","type":"project"},{"authors":["Corrado Caudek","Claudio Sica","Igor Marchetti","Ilaria Colpizzi","Debora Stendardi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593734400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593734400,"objectID":"04175a3d230b49bf84cf5cf802112866","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2020_jbct/","publishdate":"2020-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2020_jbct/","section":"publication","summary":"Individuals vulnerable to OCD show cognitive inflexibility for symptom-related tasks, but not for symptom-unrelated tasks.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Cognitive inflexibility specificity for individuals with high levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claudio Sica","Gioia Bottesi","Corrado Caudek","Igor Marchetti","Antonella Orsucci","Giulia Palmieri","Stefania Righi","Marta Ghisi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573430400,"objectID":"24ebe11dd14f3271cfede627e2e36786","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2019_ijct/","publishdate":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2019_ijct/","section":"publication","summary":"A picture-based measure of 'Not Just Right Experiences' can predicted OC symptoms.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Construct validity of 'Not Just Right Experiences': results from a picture-based assessment procedure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Serena Coppolino Perfumi","Franco Bagnoli","Corrado Caudek","Andrea Guazzini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563148800,"objectID":"453b3d808a8671e24764a1c88c210332","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2019_cihb/","publishdate":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2019_cihb/","section":"publication","summary":"Normative influence becomes almost ineffective within computer-mediated-communication when subjects are deindividuated.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Deindividuation effects on normative and informational social influence within computer-mediated-communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;

The classic references are Lord and Novick (1968) and McDonald (1999).\nInitially, Levy and Mislevy discuss the CTT by considering a single test and assuming that the measurement model parameters and the hyperparameters are known. Then they generalize to the case where there are multiple tests, still assuming that the measurement model parameters and hyperparameters are known. Finally, they consider the case where the measurement model parameters and hyperparameters are unknown. In their book, Levy and Mislevy use WinBUGS but here I re-write one of their models in Stan. I will consider the case in which the measurement model parameters and hyperparameters are unknown.\nFor each examinee $i$, $x_i$ is the observable test score. The test can be made up by several items and the test score is the sum of the responses to the individual items. According to CTT, $x_i$ is the sum of a true score (for each examinee) and of an error component:\n$$x_i = T_i + E_i,$$ where `$T_i$` is the true score for examinee `$i$`, with mean `$\\mu$` and variance `$\\sigma_T^2$` and `$E$` is the error component for examinee `$i$`, with mean 0 and variance `$\\sigma_E^2$`. Errors are assumed to be uncorrelated with true scores in the population, $$\\rho_{TE} = 0.$$ The variance of the observed scores, $\\sigma^2_x$, is the sum of the true variance and of the error variance,\n$$\\sigma^2_x = \\sigma^2_T + \\sigma^2_E,$$ from which the reliability of the test is given by the ratio between the variance of the true scores and the variance of the observed scores (that is, the proportion of observed score variance that is accounted for by the true score variance):\n$$\\rho = \\frac{\\sigma^2_T}{\\sigma^2_x}.$$ The reliability $\\rho$ also corresponds to the squared correlation between the observed scores and the true scores, $\\rho = \\rho_{xT}^2$.\nLevy and Mislevy (2016) discuss how the true scores can be estimated with Kelley\u0026rsquo;s formula (Kelley, 1923). Kelley\u0026rsquo;s formula shifts the estimate of each examinee\u0026rsquo;s true score in the direction of the sample mean by a measure which depends on the reliability of the test. If $\\rho = 1$ the observed score becomes the estimate of the true score; if $\\rho = 0$, $\\mu_x$ becomes the best estimate of the true score. The best estimate of the true score will therefore fall between $x_i$ and $\\mu_x$, and it will be closer to $x_i$ if the reliability of the test is higher.\nLevy and Mislevy (2016) show that the posterior mean obtained from a Bayesian implementation of the CTT is consistent with Kelley\u0026rsquo;s formula. They provide a formal proof of this, but here I will only replicate the MCMC estimation via Stan. I will consider here their last example, in which they consider the case of the CTT with an unknown measurement model. Specifically, Levy and Mislevy analyze the data of 10 examinees, each of them with 5 observable measures. This can be understood as the case in which the same test is administered to each examinee on five occasions, with no effects of learning or fatigue.\nI focus here on the case in which $\\mu_T$, $\\sigma_T^2$, and $\\sigma_E^2$ are unknown. The purpose is to estimate the reliability of the test and to estimate the true scores of the examinees by using only the observed scores.\nI have re-written in Stan the WinBUGS model that Levy and Mislevy (2016) present in section 8.3.3.3. Since I will use rstan, I saved the following code in a file called ctt_2.stan.\ndata { int\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; N; //the number of subjects (rows in the X matrix) int\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; J; //the number of columns in the X matrix matrix[N, J] X; //the data matrix } parameters { vector[N] T; //the true scores real mu_T; // mean of the distribution of true scores real\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; sigma_T; // sd of the distribution of true scores real\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; sigma_E; // sd of the distribution of errors } transformed parameters { } model { // Priors mu_T ~ normal(0, 200); sigma_T ~ normal(0, 20); sigma_E ~ normal(0, 20); // Likelihood for (i in 1:N) { T[i] ~ normal(mu_T, sigma_T); for (j in 1:J) { X[i, j] ~ normal(T[i], sigma_E); } } } generated quantities { real\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; reliability; real\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; reliability_composite; reliability = sigma_T^2 / (sigma_T^2 + sigma_E^2); reliability_composite = J * reliability / ((J - 1) * reliability + 1); }  Differently from Levy and Mislevy (2016), who used priors for $\\mu_T$, $\\sigma_T$, and $\\sigma_E$ centered on the correct values, I use much less informative priors in order to test the robustness of the estimation. I will not discuss here the details of the code. It is easy to find many introductions of Stan on the web. Let see instead how we can run this code in R. I used the following instructions:\nrm(list = ls(all = TRUE)) library(rstan) rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())  The previous lines of code will load Stan in the R environment after clearing the workspace. With the following instructions, I create a list with the data in the appropriate format for Stan. N is the number of examinees, J is the number of administrations of the test for each examinee, and X is the data matrix. Each row of X contains the results of one examinee, with the columns providing the results of the repeated administrations of the test.\nstan_dat \u0026lt;- list( N = 10, J = 5, X = matrix( c( 80, 77, 80, 73, 73, 83, 79, 78, 78, 77, 85, 77, 88, 81, 80, 76, 76, 76, 78, 67, 70, 69, 73, 71, 77, 87, 89, 92, 91, 87, 76, 75, 79, 80, 75, 86, 75, 80, 80, 82, 84, 79, 79, 77, 82, 96, 85, 91, 87, 90 ), nrow = 10, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE) )  I fitted the model contained in the ctt_2.stan file as follows:\nfit \u0026lt;- stan(file = \u0026quot;ctt_2.stan\u0026quot;, data = stan_dat, pars = c(\u0026quot;T\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mu_T\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sigma_T\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sigma_E\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;reliability\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;reliability_composite\u0026quot;), iter = 20000, chains = 4)  Here are the results:\nInference for Stan model: ctt_2. 4 chains, each with iter=20000; warmup=10000; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=10000, total post-warmup draws=40000. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% n_eff Rhat T[1] 76.85 0.01 1.55 73.85 75.81 76.84 77.87 79.92 32011 1 T[2] 79.07 0.01 1.54 76.05 78.04 79.07 80.08 82.12 33954 1 T[3] 82.06 0.01 1.52 79.09 81.03 82.06 83.08 85.03 32860 1 T[4] 74.99 0.01 1.53 71.96 73.97 74.99 76.00 78.01 32862 1 T[5] 72.57 0.01 1.56 69.51 71.53 72.55 73.59 75.71 32570 1 T[6] 88.55 0.01 1.57 85.41 87.53 88.58 89.60 91.58 31220 1 T[7] 77.20 0.01 1.52 74.23 76.18 77.20 78.20 80.21 32944 1 T[8] 80.58 0.01 1.52 77.57 79.57 80.58 81.59 83.56 33246 1 T[9] 80.19 0.01 1.53 77.18 79.16 80.18 81.20 83.21 33681 1 T[10] 89.12 0.01 1.58 85.94 88.07 89.14 90.18 92.17 31818 1 mu_T 80.09 0.01 2.17 75.80 78.76 80.09 81.43 84.40 24525 1 sigma_T 6.47 0.01 1.94 3.80 5.14 6.12 7.40 11.20 21723 1 sigma_E 3.56 0.00 0.41 2.86 3.26 3.52 3.81 4.48 23602 1 reliability 0.74 0.00 0.11 0.50 0.67 0.75 0.82 0.92 24608 1 reliability_composite 0.93 0.00 0.04 0.83 0.91 0.94 0.96 0.98 25083 1 lp__ -107.17 0.02 2.83 -113.67 -108.86 -106.81 -105.12 -102.70 14242 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Sun Nov 27 09:08:53 2016. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1).  The Stan implementation of Levy and Mislevy\u0026rsquo;s model works. For example, for the estimate of the true score of the first examinee, Levy and Mislevy (2016) report a mean of 76.85, a standard deviation of 1.53, and a 95% CI of $[73.87, 79.83]$. With much more generic priors, I find a mean of 76.85, a standard deviation of 1.55, and a 95% CI of $[73.85, 79.92]$. Levy and Mislevy report a reliability of the composite score of 0.93, with a standard deviation of 0.04, and a 95% CI of $[0.86, 0.98]$. I find a reliability of 0.94, with a standard deviation of 0.04, and a 95% CI of $[0.83, 0.98]$.\nIt is interesting that, even when almost uninformative priors are used, correct estimates for the parameters can be obtained.\n MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\\\(','\\\\)']], displayMath: [['$$','$$'], ['\\[','\\]']], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true, skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'], TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: \"AMS\" }, extensions: [\"AMSmath.js\", \"AMSsymbols.js\"] } } });  MathJax.Hub.Queue(function() { // Fix  tags after MathJax finishes running.

It is well known that the capacity of VWM is severely limited, but we poorly understand which information is stored and how is selected. A line of research studies the fidelity of memory representations in order to better understand the contents of VWM. In one study, we assessed the fidelity of VWM for faces and non-face objects. In two experiments, four levels of memory load (1, 2, 3, or 4 items) were combined with four perceptual distances between probe and study items, with maximum item confusability occurring for the minimum memory load. Under these conditions, recognition memory for multiple faces exceeded that of a single face. This result was primarily due to the higher false alarm rates for faces than non-face objects, even though the two classes of stimuli had been matched for perceptual discriminability. Control experiments revealed that this counter-intuitive result emerged only for old–new recognition choices based on near-threshold image differences. For non-face objects, instead, recognition performance decreased with increasing memory load. It is speculated that the low memorial discriminability of the transient properties of a face may serve the purpose of enhancing recognition at the individual-exemplar level.\n Caudek, C. (2013).

A highly debated topic is whether faces are processed differently from other objects. In one of the studies that we have carried out to explore the nature of face processing, we have examined the prioritization of attention to emotional faces. It has been hypothesized that a rapid response to a threatening face in a crowd is important to successfully interact in social environments. In our study, a visual search tasks was employed to determine whether there is a processing advantage for detecting an angry face in a crowd, compared to a happy face. In the literature, the empirical findings supporting the anger superiority effect (ASE) have been criticized on the basis of possible low-level visual confounds and because of the limited ecological validity of the stimuli. Moreover, a happiness superiority effect is usually found with more realistic stimuli. In our study, we tested the ASE by using dynamic (and static) images of realistic human faces, with validated emotional expressions having similar intensities, after controlling the bottom-up visual saliency and the amount of image motion. In five experiments, we found strong evidence for an ASE when using dynamic displays of facial expressions, but not when the emotions were expressed by static face images.\n Ceccarini, F., \u0026amp; Caudek, C.

Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.\n Horton, R. (2015). What is medicine\u0026rsquo;s 5 sigma? The Lancet, 385(9976), 1380.\n Andrew Gelman\u0026rsquo;s blog reports a long-lasting discussion on such topic, which is very interesting to follow. Although not everybody agrees, the null-hypothesis-significance-testing (NHST) approach fares quite badly in this crisis, which is not only a crisis in psychology, obviously (actually, it seems much worse elsewhere). Small effect sizes, small samples, small signal-to-noise ratios, and still the p-value can, quite easily, be smaller than .05. The NHST was such a simple procedure: is it any wonder that it could only fail? Should I wonder how the first-year psychology students would react, if we started teaching Bayesian statistic rather than the frequentist approach? Or, should I ask, when will it happen?\nWell, apart from the NHST, apart from the degrees of freedom of the experimenter, the money that comes from \u0026lsquo;observing\u0026rsquo; a given result rather than another, the garden of forking paths, the bad decisions of the Government agencies that dictate the criteria for career progression in academia, I think that it is worthwhile to remember the provocation of Nelson, Simmons, and Simonsohn (2012), who proposed the Utopia in which researchers are allowed to publish only one paper per year.\n Publication quantity is no longer a relevant dimension. This system incentivizes researchers to demonstrate that an effect is robust and generalizable, and hence true and important.\n  \u0026hellip; if Hari Seldon arrived at work and the published literature was slimmer and more digestible, would he be worse off? Furthermore, rather than wondering about how to evaluate two job candidates who differ in quality and quantity, Seldon would instead see candidates who were matched on the latter, allowing him to entirely focus on the former. Finally, Hari can pursue his own work with improved clarity and focus. There is only one paper to write this year. He had better make it count.\n What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with that?\n","date":1475501400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475501400,"objectID":"419545a9999cd14f16a9a4c961c3dd59","permalink":"/post/2016/crisis/","publishdate":"2016-10-03T08:30:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2016/crisis/","section":"post","summary":"In case you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard it, the joke goes like this: not only the results of the research cannot be replicated, even the absence of replication cannot be replicated.\nRichard Horton put it very clearly:","tags":["replicability","research"],"title":"Replicability crisis in psychology","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The cognitive model of depression hypothesize that depressed and cognitive vulnerable individuals are prone to emotional biases in attention, interpretation, and memory which could exacerbate distress. In one project, we studied the effects of negative cognitive style, sad mood, and facial affect on the short-term memory for the self-face and for other faces. Following a sad mood induction, we examined the effect on working memory of an incidental association between facial affect, facial identity, and head-pose orientation. We found that participants high in negative cognitive style who experienced higher levels of sadness displayed a stronger self-face advantage (SFA) for sad expressions than happy expressions. The remaining participants displayed an opposite bias (a stronger SFA for happy expressions than sad expressions), or no bias. These findings highlight the importance of trait-vulnerability status in the working memory biases related to emotional facial expressions.\n Caudek, C., \u0026amp; Monni, A. (2013).
