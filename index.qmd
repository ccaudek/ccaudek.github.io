### Welcome to my personal website!

I am an Associate Professor of Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/en), Italy. My research explores individual differences in cognitive styles and strategies, with a focus on associative learning deficits, eating disorders, and self-compassion. The overarching aim of my work is to contribute to the development of more effective intervention strategies for psychological disorders, both at the individual and population levels.
